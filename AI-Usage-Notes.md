**Hii Convert Cart Team,**

Before you jump into my *AI Usage Notes* walkthrough, let me just say — I’m genuinely **happy and thankful** that you gave me this assessment.  

Now, truth be told, the task itself didn’t have any new complexities or unfamiliar patterns for me — I’ve worked on similar structures before and even built multiple projects around the same workflow. But here’s the fun part: because of this exercise, I decided to experiment with a *brand-new tech combo* —  

`Next.js + TypeScript + Module Federation = Microfrontends`.  

Turns out, this is a **wild ride** on the latest Next version. I quickly learned that:  
- Module Federation *only* plays nicely with **React 18 + Next 14 + JavaScript**.  
- TypeScript adds its own runtime quirks, especially when fetching components dynamically.  
- You often end up facing weird traps — like unexpected `null` states and random hydration errors.

After many rounds of trial and error, I finally got it working. But Tailwind styling wasn’t applying properly due to the latest support issues… and for this project, I wasn’t willing to make that trade-off.

### How I Used AI Along the Way
Instead of getting stuck, I brought in AI as my *tech sidekick* — not to solve the hard logic, but to handle the repetitive, time-consuming stuff.  

Here’s what AI helped me with:
- Building a **React Syntax Highlighter** without any docs (even though it’s one of the most popular libraries out there).  
- Structuring files quickly with one-line commands like  
  `"touch middlewares/logger"` — based on my own directory plan.  
- Generating **README prompts** with the structure I wanted.  
- Assisting in creating a **test suite**.  
- Helping with **TS config adjustments** due to deprecations and development resets.  
- Writing **Swagger documentation**.  
- Creating small React components that were functional but repetitive.

I used multiple AI models in parallel — Grok, Perplexity, and ChatGPT. I skipped Claude and Cursor only because my tokens there were already drained from other projects.

### The Twist
And here’s the kicker — this **AI_USAGE_NOTES** file you’re reading right now?  
Completely *written by me*, no AI involved.  

This has been both a learning curve and a fun experiment, and I’m glad I got to push my skills and tools in new directions.

Thanks again,
